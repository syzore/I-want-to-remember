# I Want to Remember  
A system designed to help you learn and retain knowledge through carefully spaced question cards.  

## How It Works  

1. **Choose Topics That Interest You**  
   - Start with a broad category like Mathematics, History, or Biology.  
   - Selecting a category reveals a list of subcategories.  
   - Clicking on a node expands related topics using a knowledge graph (similar to Wikipedia links).  
   - Each selected node is added to your "Things I Want to Learn" list.  

2. **Learn & Test Your Knowledge**  
   - Click on a node to access learning options:  
     - **Learn This** – Starts from the basics, teaching concepts and guiding you through the topic.  
     - **Quiz Me** – Tests your knowledge. If you answer correctly, you progress; if not, the system teaches you before moving forward.  

3. **Remember What You Learn**  
   - The system generates small and large question cards based on your chosen topics.  
   - Uses **spaced repetition** to reinforce learning over time, ensuring long-term retention.  

## Why Use This?  
✅ Personalized learning based on your interests.  
✅ Adaptive quizzes that help reinforce understanding.  
✅ Spaced repetition to improve memory retention.
